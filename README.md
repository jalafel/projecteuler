#Mission

This project is a personal commitment to improving algorithmic practices
in mathematics and applied programming. It utilizes the exercises
presented from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Each solution is presented with meta data of how long it took,
whether or not I used outside resources, and the concepts that
I acquired from completing the solution.

I recognize that I learn better by through _application_,
and I hope that this exercise will help refine my understanding
of mathematics.
